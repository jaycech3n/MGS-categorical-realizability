\chapter{Acknowledgements}

It is my pleasure to express my sincere thanks to Jaap van Oosten---to whom I
have dedicated these notes---for teaching an excellent course on category
theory~\cite{vanOosten2016} and introducing me to realizability when I was a
master's student in mathematics at Utrecht University back in 2015--2018.

I thank Ignacio Bellas, Rahul Chhabra, Josh Chen, Stefania Damato, Johnson He,
Chris Purdy, Vincent Rahli, Alyssa Renata, Jingjie Yang and Mark Williams for
pointing out or fixing typos, and Mart\'in Escard\'o for a discussion on the BHK
interpretation.

I~am also grateful to Josh Chen for volunteering to be a teaching assistant for
the course.
